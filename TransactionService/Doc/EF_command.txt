Be always use the code based migrations since I have not found any clue for how to rollback the Migrations in automatical Migrations mode.

// create support tables in db, and create the first batch of tables defined in project.
// and create Migrations in local project.
// !!!make sure you select the target Project in 'Package Manager Console'
Enable-Migrations

// generate a migration file with the name specified.
Add-Migration [Name]

// re-generate the migration file which will overwrite the existed one with the name specified.
Add-Migration [Name] -Force

// update database to latest migration file
Update-Database

// update database to migration file with specified name, use this for rollback/undo migrations.
Update-Database –TargetMigration: [Name]

// update database to initialized state which means no migartion file is applied.
Update-Database –TargetMigration: $InitialDatabase

// generate a script file which include all the migartions from the beginning to a migration by name
// specified.
// omit the :-TargetMigration: [Name] will assume TargetMigration is latest.
Update-Database -Script -SourceMigration: $InitialDatabase -TargetMigration: [Name]
